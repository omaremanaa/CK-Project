MRT users wait in the carriage after a signalling problem causes delays.
KUALA LUMPUR: MRT commuters were hit with delays today following a signalling problem along the line from the Mutiara Damansara to Bukit Bintang stations.
Commuters told FMT that the problem started around 9.30am when the trains stopped at each station for an extended period of between 20 to 40 minutes.
“The trains were full so I, along with many others, got off at the Merdeka station to switch to the LRT,” said one commuter who declined to be named, adding that her journey to work was delayed by nearly two hours.
When contacted, a spokesman from MRT confirmed the problem, citing a failure in the automatic controlling system.
“Because of this, there was a signalling problem along certain stretches, so we were driving the train manually which was what caused the delay.”
He added that as of noon, the signalling issue had been rectified although the trains were still moving on manual mode.
Last year, it was reported that thousands of MRT users along the Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line arrived late for work after a delay caused by signalling issues.
