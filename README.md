Developed a code to solve problems which is related to an integrated public transportation in Malaysia with algorithms.

*Malaysia has developed an integrated public transportation network which provides multiple options to passenger. 
Passenger may take the furthest route due to the lack of information on determining the combination of public transportation to get to their destination.

*Even the shortest path able to be determine, passengers are still facing daily problem due to the long waiting time. 
The unusual and unexpected condition during the journey such as unexpected traffic congestion, unexpected delay, randomness in passengers’ demands and weather changes need to be considered before making suggestion.

*The hassle question faced by passengers to decide which options should be taken depending on the time and situation. 
For example, “Should I wait for the bus at this time, or should I walk a few miles to the train station, or should I just take a grab as the traffic at this time may not be congested”
